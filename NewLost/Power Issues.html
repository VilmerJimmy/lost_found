  <h3>Power issues mainly include the following</h3>
	
  <li>Any power-on or system startup failures or lockups.</li>
  <li>Spontaneous rebooting or intermittent lockups during normal operation.</li>
  <li>Hard disk and fan simultaneously failing to spin (no +12v).</li>
  <li>Overheating due to fan failure.</li>
  <li>Electric shocks felt on the system case or connectors.</li>
  <li>System is completely dead (no fan, no cursor)</li>
  <li> Smoke</li>
  <li> Blown circuit breakers</li>
</ul>
	<div class="container">
</div>
If you suspect a power supply problem, some of the simple measurements and the more sophisticated tests outlined in this section can help you determine whether the power supply is at fault. <br/>Because these measurements might not detect some intermittent failures, you might have to use a spare power supply for a long-term evaluation.<br/> If the symptoms and problems disappear when a known good spare unit is installed, you have found the source of your problem.</div>
<br/><br/>
<div class="container">
The following is a simple flowchart to help you zero in on common power supply–related problems:
	<ol>

    <li>Check AC power input. Make sure the cord is firmly seated in the wall socket and in the power supply socket. Try a different cord.</li><br/>

    <li>Check DC power connections. Make sure the motherboard and disk drive power connectors are firmly seated and making good contact. Check for loose screws.</li><br/>

    <li>Check DC power output. Use a digital multimeter to check for proper voltages. If it's below spec, replace the power supply.</li><br/>

    <li>Check installed peripherals. Remove all boards and drives and retest the system. If it works, add back in items one at a time until the system fails again. The last item added before the failure returns is likely defective.</li>
</ol>
	<div class="container">
</div>
Many types of symptoms can indicate problems with the power supply. Because the power supply literally powers everything else in the system, everything from disk drive problems to memory problems to motherboard problems can often be traced back to the power supply as the root cause.<br/><br/>

<li>Overloaded Power Supplies</li>

A weak or inadequate power supply can put a damper on your ideas for system expansion. Some systems are designed with beefy power supplies, as if to anticipate a great deal of system add-ons and expansion components. Most desktop or tower systems are built in this manner. Some systems have inadequate power supplies from the start, however, and cannot adequately service the power-hungry options you might want to add.
		<br/><br/>

<li>The wattage rating can sometimes be very misleading</li>.<br/>

		Not all 300-watt supplies are created the same. People familiar with high-end audio systems know that some watts are better than others. This goes for power supplies, too.<br/><br/>
		Cheap power supplies might in fact put out the rated power, but what about noise and distortion? Some of the supplies are under-engineered to just barely meet their specifications, whereas others might greatly exceed their specifications.<br/> 
		Many of the cheaper supplies provide noisy or unstable power, which can cause numerous problems with the system. Another problem with under-engineered power supplies is that they can run hot and force the system to do so as well. <br/>
		The repeated heating and cooling of solid-state components eventually causes a computer system to fail, and engineering principles dictate that the hotter a PC's temperature, the shorter its life. Many people recommend replacing the original supply in a system with a heavier-duty model, which solves the problem. <br/>
<li>Inadequate Cooling</li><br/>
<img src="images/SYSTEM/IMG_20190402_081006.jpg" width="300" height="218" alt=""/> <br/>

Some of the available replacement power supplies have higher-capacity cooling fans than the originals, which can greatly prolong system life and minimize overheating problems—especially for the newer, hotter-running processors. If system noise is a problem, models with special fans can run more quietly than the standard models. These power supplies often use larger-diameter fans that spin more slowly, so they run more quietly but move the same amount of air as the smaller fans. PC Power and Cooling specializes in heavy-duty and quiet supplies; Astec has several heavy-duty models as well.
<br/><br/>
<li>Ventilation in a system is also important.</li> <br/>
<img src="images/SYSTEM/IMG_20190402_080834.jpg" width="300" height="194" alt=""/><br/>
You must ensure adequate airflow to cool the hotter items in the system. Many processors today use passive heatsinks that require a steady stream of air to cool the chip. If the processor heatsink has its own fan, this is not much of a concern. <br/>
If you have free expansion slots, you should space out the boards in your system to permit airflow between them. Place the hottest running boards nearest the fan or the ventilation holes in the system. <br/><br/>
Make sure that adequate airflow exists around the hard disk drive, especially for those that spin at high rates of speed.<br/>
Some hard disks can generate quite a bit of heat during operation. If the hard disks overheat, data can be lost.<br/><br/>
<br/>
<li>Always be sure to run your computer with the case cover on, especially if you have a loaded system.</li><br/>
Removing the cover can actually cause a system to overheat. With the cover off, the power supply fan no longer draws air through the system. Instead, the fan ends up cooling the supply only, and the rest of the system must be cooled by simple convection.<br/>
Although most systems do not immediately overheat for this reason, several of my own systems, especially those that are fully expanded, have overheated within 15–30 minutes when run with the case cover off.
<br/>

<br/><br/>
<em>If you experience intermittent problems that you suspect are related to overheating, a higher-capacity replacement power supply is usually the best cure.</em>
