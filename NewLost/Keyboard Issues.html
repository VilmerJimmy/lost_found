    If there are certain keys that are not working properly or becoming unresponsive slowly then dust can be a reason behind that failure. Turn the keyboard upside down to release the dust off from the keyboard. If that does not work, then buy a jet spray to get the job done for the same issue.<br/>
    
    <li><strong>System problem</strong></li>
    <br/>

    Every system has a set of operating systems on which the keyboard layout depends on.
    
    If you are tapping a particular key and ending up getting the totally opposite letter on screen then the system is might be using the different keyboard layout possibly. You can change the keyboard layout as per your choice by heading towards control panel ,keyboard settings.<br/>
  </ol>
  Finally,
  <br/>
  <em>
  A keyboard is not one of the sensitive device which fails so quickly. You can work on the same keyboard as long as you want without any replacement. Keep all of these points in mind whenever you face a keyboard failure. If the issue does not get resolved then you might need to purchase a new keyboard immediately.
